### FastAPI Wireshark Uploader App

Uses the FastAPI framework to create a REST API that allows users to upload their exported Wireshark files (JSON format) to a MongoDB Atlas database. After each upload, the `packets` endpoint returns an extracted version of the results to the client as well. The packets.py file is to be customized to whatever protocol you want to analyze, the choices seem to be endless! ðŸ˜Ž

The app is written in Python and uses the PyMongo library to connect to MongoDB Atlas.

Uses Python's Poetry package manager to manage dependencies.

## Requirements

-   Poetry
-   MongoDB Atlas account (and connection string)
-   Wireshark JSON file
-   MongoDB Atlas db/collection names (these are to be created in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Poetry
3. Run `poetry install` to install dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` file
4. Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment
5. Run `uvicorn app:app --reload` to start the server

## Usage

1. Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

2. Upload a Wireshark JSON file

3. After the upload is complete, you'll be redirected to the `packets` endpoint, which will display the extracted results from the uploaded file.

4. To view the results in MongoDB Atlas, you can use MongoDB Compass (my favorite way to do it) or the MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
